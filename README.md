SYLLABUS - EE 511 (SPRING 2019)
SIMULATION METHODS FOR STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS
Course Description:
Randomness and uncertainty are an integral part of nature e.g. random variations in weather, human
traffic, epidemic spread, stock prices, etc. Stochastic models are important tools for characterizing such
random phenomena. The goal of this course is to develop a facility with working with a couple of
models for stochastic simulation and analysis. The course starts with an introduction into tools for
generating and validating models of randomness. We take a look at maximum likelihood methods for
characterizing and clustering random data. Then we end by learning to put randomness to work on
optimization and estimation applications like machine learning modeling using Monte Carlo and
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
Requirements:
A graduate-level maturity in mathematics. Students should either have taken EE503. Students should
have some programming experience, preferably in MATLAB, Python, or R. You may want to consider
starting a GitHub repository for your code solutions. Your performance on the projects determines
your grade.
